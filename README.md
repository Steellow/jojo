# jojo58

Config files for my keyboard, lily58. Works with [Vial](https://get.vial.today/).

Why jojo58? Because the keyboard is [lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58) and I have JoJo stickers on the keyboard.

## Keymap

You can find the keymap.vil file on the repo. Load it to Vial from File -> Load saved layout...

I'm still experimenting with the keymap. Will (probably) upload pictures of the keymap here once I've settled with some good ones.

- Layer 0: The basic layer you use 99% of the time
- Layer 1: Symbol layer
- Layer 2: Arrow keys, function keys, volume keys and other special stuff
- Layer 3: DOESN'T WORK (dunno if problem with my hardware or qmk, don't care)
- Layer 4: Planning to do a gaming layer here, with better buttons for m&k gaming
- Layer 5: Nothing (yet)
