Config files for my keyboard, lily58. Works with [Vial](https://get.vial.today/).

## Keymap

I'm still experimenting with the keymap. Will (probably) upload pictures of the keymap here once I've settled with some good ones.

- Layer 0: The basic layer you use 99% of the time
- Layer 1: Symbol layer
- Layer 2: Arrow keys, function keys, volume keys and other special stuff
- Layer 3: DOESN'T WORK (dunno if problem with my hardware or qmk, don't care)
- Layer 4: Planning to do a gaming layer here, with better buttons for m&k gaming
